description: Update model metadata for the pi-synthetic extension. Use when adding or refreshing entries in src/extensions/provider/models.ts. Start by running the model tests, inspect current hardcoded definitions, fetch live data from Synthetic and models.dev, then update the file proactively without asking the user which model to change.

# Update Synthetic model

Update `src/extensions/provider/models.ts` from live data, not guesswork.

## Default behavior

Take initiative.

Do not start by asking which model to update. First detect drift, then update whatever needs updating:

1. Run `pnpm install` to ensure local dependencies are up to date.
2. Run the model test to find mismatches and new models.
3. Read the current hardcoded definitions in `src/extensions/provider/models.ts`.
4. Fetch live model data from:
   - `https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/models`
   - `https://models.dev/api.json`
5. Reconcile the differences.
6. Edit `src/extensions/provider/models.ts`.
7. Re-run the relevant tests.

Only ask the user if there is a real blocker, such as missing credentials for runtime validation or conflicting evidence you cannot resolve.

## Sources of truth

Use these in order:

1. Synthetic models endpoint: `https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/models`
2. Existing test failures from `src/extensions/provider/models.test.ts`
3. `https://models.dev/api.json` under `.synthetic.models`
4. Synthetic runtime behavior via direct `chat/completions` calls when needed
5. If a model is missing under Synthetic on models.dev, inspect the same model under other providers on models.dev only as supporting evidence

## Required workflow

### 0) Install dependencies

Run `pnpm install` first to ensure local dependencies are up to date:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 1) Start with tests

Run the targeted model test so you know what changed:

```bash
pnpm test -- src/extensions/provider/models.test.ts
```

Use the failures to identify:

- stale fields on existing models
- models that exist in code but no longer exist upstream
- new Synthetic models missing from `SYNTHETIC_MODELS`
- upstream backend changes in the model `provider` field

If the test passes, still check for drift manually by reading the current file and comparing with fresh endpoint data. Do not assume no work is needed just because tests pass.

### 2) Inspect current definitions

Read:

- `src/extensions/provider/models.ts`
- `src/extensions/provider/models.test.ts`

Use the current file shape and comments as the formatting baseline.

### 3) Fetch Synthetic endpoint data

Query the full model list, then inspect affected models.

Example:

```bash
curl -s https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/models \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.id=="hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash")'
```

Useful narrow query:

```bash
curl -s https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/models \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.id==$id) | {
      id,
      name,
      input_modalities,
      output_modalities,
      context_length,
      max_output_length,
      provider,
      pricing,
      supported_features
    }' --arg id 'hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash'
```

The endpoint `provider` field is the upstream backend Synthetic uses for that model. A value of `synthetic` means the model is hosted by Synthetic directly. Values such as `fireworks` or `together` mean Synthetic proxies the request to that backend.

### 4) Fetch models.dev data

Check the Synthetic provider entry first:

```bash
curl -sL -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://models.dev/api.json \
  | jq '.synthetic.models["hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7"]'
```

If missing under Synthetic, inspect other providers:

```bash
curl -sL -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://models.dev/api.json \
  | jq 'to_entries
    | map({provider: .key, model: .value.models["hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash"]})
    | map(select(.model != null))
    | map({provider, reasoning: .model.reasoning, input: .model.modalities.input, maxTokens: .model.max_output_tokens})'
```

## Field mapping

Copy these directly from the Synthetic endpoint when available:

- `id`
- `name`
- `provider` -> `provider` (`synthetic` for Synthetic-hosted models, otherwise the proxied upstream backend such as `fireworks` or `together`)
- `context_length` -> `contextWindow`
- `max_output_length` -> `maxTokens` when present and trustworthy
- `pricing.prompt` -> `cost.input` per 1M
- `pricing.completion` -> `cost.output` per 1M
- `pricing.input_cache_reads` -> `cost.cacheRead` per 1M
- `pricing.input_cache_writes` -> `cost.cacheWrite` per 1M
- `input_modalities` -> `input`

Cross-check these from models.dev:

- `reasoning`
- `modalities.input`
- `max_output_tokens` / output token limit when Synthetic metadata is absent or suspicious

## Decision rules

- Start from test failures, but update all clearly stale entries you find in the same pass.
- Add new models when the Synthetic endpoint exposes them and they fit the existing provider scope.
- Remove models only when they are truly gone from Synthetic, not because of a temporary fetch issue.
- Set `input` from the Synthetic endpoint first.
- Set pricing from the Synthetic endpoint.
- Set `provider` from the Synthetic endpoint. Do not infer hosting from the model name. `synthetic` means Synthetic-hosted; `fireworks`, `together`, or another value means Synthetic proxies to that backend.
- A model with `provider` other than `"synthetic"` will be hidden from users when the **Proxied Models** setting is disabled.
- Set `contextWindow` from the Synthetic endpoint.
- Set `maxTokens` from Synthetic when exposed; otherwise use models.dev Synthetic data.
- Set `reasoning` from:
  1. confirmed Synthetic runtime behavior
  2. else Synthetic endpoint `supported_features`
  3. else models.dev Synthetic entry
  4. else other providers on models.dev as weak evidence only
- Keep existing `compat` unless live behavior or current repo conventions show it should change.
- Do not ask the user which models to update unless there is a true ambiguity you cannot resolve.

### Alias models

Synthetic exposes permanent aliases (IDs starting with `syn:`) that route to underlying concrete models. These are thin references — they have no `provider`, `cost`, `contextWindow`, or `compat` of their own.

**Identifying aliases:** Query the API for entries with `hugging_face_id` where the ID does not start with `hf:`:

```bash
curl -s https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/models \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.hugging_face_id != null and (.id | startswith("hf:") | not)) | {id, name, hugging_face_id}'
```

**Mapping:**
- `id` -> `id` (keep the `syn:` prefix)
- `name` -> `name`
- `hugging_face_id` -> `aliasFor`, prefixed with `hf:` (e.g. `hugging_face_id: "zai-org/GLM-5.1"` becomes `aliasFor: "hf:zai-org/GLM-5.1"`)

**Rules:**
- `syn:*` entries must be at the top of `SYNTHETIC_MODELS` to stay visible regardless of `proxiedModels` setting
- Alias entries are only `{ id, name, aliasFor }`. Do not copy `provider`, `cost`, `contextWindow`, `maxTokens`, `compat`, or `thinkingLevelMap` from the API
- Alias metadata (`cost`, `contextWindow`, `compat`, `thinkingLevelMap`) is resolved at build time from the concrete target
- Alias `provider` is always forced to `"synthetic"` at build time regardless of the target's actual `provider`
- When Synthetic changes which model an alias routes to, update only the `aliasFor` field
- If an alias's API-reported metadata diverges from its target's metadata (e.g. pricing, context length), alert the user — this likely means the alias should become a concrete entry or the target has changed

**Reasoning level classification for aliases:**
- Classify reasoning for the **concrete target model only**, not the alias
- The alias inherits `thinkingLevelMap` and `compat.supportsReasoningEffort` from its target automatically
- Do not set `thinkingLevelMap` or `compat` on alias entries

## Required runtime checks

Do not rely only on metadata for `reasoning` or multimodal support when the evidence is mixed or when you are adding a new model with unclear behavior.

Use the environment variable `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`. Never print it.

### Reasoning check

```bash
curl -sS https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNTHETIC_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @- <<'JSON'
{
  "model": "hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with ok"}],
  "reasoning_effort": "low",
  "max_completion_tokens": 64
}
JSON
```

Treat `reasoning` as supported if the request succeeds and clearly accepts reasoning mode.

### Reasoning level classification

When adding or updating a reasoning model, determine whether it supports multiple reasoning levels or is binary on/off. This affects the `thinkingLevelMap` and `compat.supportsReasoningEffort` settings.

Test the model with `reasoning_effort` set to `low`, `medium`, and `high`:

```bash
for effort in low medium high; do
  echo "=== $effort ==="
  curl -sS https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNTHETIC_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d @- <<JSON
{
  "model": "MODEL_ID",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 17*23? Reply with just the number."}],
  "reasoning_effort": "$effort",
  "max_completion_tokens": 256
}
JSON
done
```

Compare `reasoning_content` length and `reasoning_tokens` across the three levels:

- **Multi-level**: `reasoning_content` length differs substantially across levels (e.g. 14c vs 208c vs 586c). No `thinkingLevelMap` needed; Pi's default level map applies.
- **Binary on/off**: `reasoning_content` is either absent or roughly the same at all non-off levels. Set `thinkingLevelMap` to `{ off: "none", minimal: null, low: null, medium: "medium", high: null, xhigh: null }` so Pi presents a single reasoning toggle.

Also test whether `reasoning_effort: "none"` actually disables reasoning:

```bash
curl -sS https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNTHETIC_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @- <<'JSON'
{
  "model": "MODEL_ID",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 17*23? Reply with just the number."}],
  "reasoning_effort": "none",
  "max_completion_tokens": 256
}
JSON
```

- If `reasoning_content` disappears and `reasoning_tokens` drops to 0: set `off: "none"` (Pi sends `reasoning_effort: "none"` when the user disables reasoning).
- If the model still produces `reasoning_content` with `"none"`: set `off: null` (hides the "off" level from Pi's UI since the model cannot disable reasoning).

When adding a `thinkingLevelMap`, also add `supportsReasoningEffort: true` to `compat` so Pi sends the `reasoning_effort` parameter.

### Image input check

```bash
curl -sS https://api.synthetic.new/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNTHETIC_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @- <<'JSON'
{
  "model": "hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image? Reply in 3 words max."},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8/x8AAusB9WnR0i8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="}}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "max_completion_tokens": 32
}
JSON
```

If Synthetic rejects image input, keep `input: ["text"]`.

## Compat rules

`src/extensions/provider/models.ts` includes a required `provider` field and supports an optional `compat` object per model.

`provider` is maintenance metadata only. `registerSyntheticProvider` strips it before registering models with Pi, so it must describe Synthetic's upstream backend, not the Pi provider name users select.

Only add or change `compat` when live behavior, provider quirks, or current repo conventions require it.

Model-level fields:

- `thinkingLevelMap` — maps Pi thinking levels to provider-specific values; `null` hides a level from the UI

Compat fields:

- `supportsDeveloperRole`
- `supportsReasoningEffort`
- `maxTokensField`
- `requiresToolResultName`
- `requiresMistralToolIds`

Do not add `compat` by default.

**Aliases inherit `compat` and `thinkingLevelMap` from their target.** Do not add `compat` or `thinkingLevelMap` to alias entries.

## Output expectations

When done:

1. Ensure `src/extensions/provider/models.ts` is updated, including correct `provider` values for Synthetic-hosted vs proxied models.
2. Re-run `pnpm test -- src/extensions/provider/models.test.ts`.
3. If the change is user-facing, prepare a changeset per repo conventions.
4. Commit the model update and changeset. **Never use `--no-verify`.**
5. If the pre-commit hooks fail (typecheck, lint, test), **stash the model changes** (`git stash`) and investigate the failing hook. Fix the underlying issue but **do not commit the fix yourself** — report the findings to the user and let them decide.
6. Summarize what changed, including newly added, removed, or materially corrected models.
